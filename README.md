# Typescript Starter Pack

### Some notes about the project:
* It's not intended for serious projects (just for my personal use)
* You're can do whatever with this code
* Based on https://github.com/kinotto/node-typescript-webpack-starter. Editions:
  * .vscode directory was removed (doesn't fit my needs)
  * Some packages were refreshed to their latest versions
* Rest of README.md is from original repository

## Usage

clone the repository then:

`npm install` or `yarn install`

`npm start` (to start the server)

`npm build` (to build the code)

## Features

- **typescript**: transpiling from .ts to ES5
- **webpack**: bundling the source to a bundle.js
- **live compiling**: as well as live reload 
- **custom .vscode**: added custom vscode configuration to allow easy debugging of the source inside Visual Studio Code
